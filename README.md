# TCK-Prueba-Front-Maquetacion
 
### Description

The website is composed of two pages. The first shows 4 different hotel’s services. The users have the possibility to choose only one of them. When the button is selected, the web page switches to the second one. Here the clients find out more promotions.
Both pages are related so if the users don't select a service they are not allowed to navigate to the next page.
 

### What I have used

This website has been done using HTML CSS and JS. I have been using the **WebPack**, created in node. This Kit includes a templates engine, preprocessor SASS and a local server.
I have created **copys** where I have written the json for creating a dynamic page. I did it in another branch called “dinamic_web”.
In addiction I have use the method **mobile first**, the page is responsive in 370px, 768ps and 1280px.

### MY Methodology 
I did a TODO.md where I have planed the day for achiving the goal.


#### Mobile first tab1-tab2

On mobile I decided to hide the header with the buttons (tab1 and tab2), which authorized the clients to move to the next page, as a result I have decided to display only the different hotel’s services. 
 
When the users have selected one, as I have described previously, the web page switches to the second tab with more details and where they can find a fixed button to move back to the home page.
 
The header (with the button tab1 and tab2) shows up in ipad and pc version, and in the tab1 the btn tab2 is disabled.

## How to start the project

```
npm install
```
## How to lunch the project

```
npm run dev
```

## I would like to 

* to implement the javascript function for switching from the first page to the second one and creating an alert when the users don't select any options. 
* to figure out the js function for the rotating arrow. 
*  to implement grid in the entire project for a more fluid mediaqueries.
* to use sass and the different partials and finish the dynamic part. 
* to clean and boost the code.
